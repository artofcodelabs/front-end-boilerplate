This repository contains boilerplate code for everyone who wants to create a multi-page website powered by all the modern tools such as:

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router) - a collection of navigational components
* [**Loco-JS-Model**](https://github.com/locoframework/loco-js-model) - a missing model layer for JavaScript. Give it a try - it's a neat solution for handling RESTful resources
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - a JavaScript compiler
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with plugins - a module bundler
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - add a bit of style to your website
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) - delightful JavaScript testing
* [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io) - end-to-end testing, simplified
* Linters + [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
